## Introduction

Building sustainable automated infrastructure is very similar to building a large software development project of microservices. A lot of the same principles apply such as keeping stateful data centralized and organized and building stateless services with well defined interfaces. This same design is also reflected in the Unix philosophy of many small tools that can be combined in a multitude of ways to do different things along with a well organized filesystem of stateful data.
